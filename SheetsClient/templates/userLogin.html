This is a Prototype that I have developed using the MEAN stack, in particular <mark>Angular2</mark> for the Front End. 
<br>
The Client, a Financial Institution, wants to launch on the market a new Family of products dedicated exclusively 
to the Digital channel. Each of these products represents a bundle of financial instruments (stocks, bonds, funds) 
selected by the Financial Institution around a certain investment theme (e.g. Automotive in East Asia or Energy 
in North America). Inspiration for this family of Products has been derived from Motif (<a target="_blank" 
href="https://www.motifinvesting.com/motifs#catalog=our">www.motifinvesting.com</a>).
<br>
The main characteristics of the products and how the presale/sale processes should be developed on the Digital channel have
been derived from some conversations I held with the client.
<br>
Starting from the what has emerged in these conversations, leveraging Motif as an example, I have built the Prototype.

The prototype has been developed with <mark>Angular2</mark> and <mark>Typescript</mark> for the front end, <mark>Express/NodeJS</mark>
 to build a simple light server using <mark>MongoDB</mark> as DB.
<br>
We need still to work on ‘Responsiveness’ (i.e. make the site work optimally on different devices which have different 
screen sizes) and multi browser support (now the prototype works best with Chrome and last Safari).
<br>
A part from these 2 points, we think that the Prototype in its front end (Angular2) part is 'production quality' code. 
We leverage greatly the composition pattern (via Angular2 components) and have based the solution on a sound Object Oriented
model (made possible by the use of Typescript).

The prototype covers the following <strong><em>functionalities</em></strong>:
<br>
- <strong>Dashboard</strong> (basically the <strong>Product Catalogue</strong>): in this page all the available products are shown with different search and
sorting criteria
<br>
- <strong>Detailed View</strong>: shows the details of a single product (e.g. description, financial data, charts, assets that compose the 
product); through this view we can also customize the product (within the limits set by the min/max rules) and save 
the customized version.
<br>
- <strong>Compare view</strong>: we can compare 2 Products
<br>
- <strong>Proposal view</strong>: starting from the Details view we can create a Proposal (if we are acting as PFA)
<br>
- <strong>Proposal list and detail view</strong>: if we enter as customer, we can see the list of our proposals, we can select one, modify the 
amount of investment and, eventually, decide to buy. The process ends with the creation of a message which can go to the 
back end system responsible for the execution of the orders on the market.

If you fill both the PFA and Customer IDs then it means that you are working as a PFA who wants to prepare a proposal for a Customer. 
If a Customer Mail is provided, when a proposal is saved, a mail is sent to the mail address.<br>
If you fill just the Customer ID (leaving the PFA ID empty) then it means that you are entering as a customer and you are 
entitled to view the proposals that the PFA has prepared for you.
